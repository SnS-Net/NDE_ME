# Python for Network Administrators and Engineers

Python is an invaluable tool for network administrators and engineers. Whether you're managing routers, switches, or Linux servers, Python can significantly streamline your workflow and help you automate tasks. This README.md file provides an overview of the Python Networking Development Environment (NDE), a structured environment to support your networking tasks.

## NDE File Structure
The NDE follows a well-organized file structure to make it easy for system administrators and network engineers to work with Python effectively. Here's the directory structure of your Python Networking Development Environment (NDE):
```plaintext
NDE_ME/
│
├── 🐍 python/
│   ├── 📘 runbooks/
│   │   ├── 🐧 linux_config/
│   │   ├── 📡 cisco_config/
│   ├── 📄 templates/
│   │   ├── 🐧 linux/
│   │   ├── 📡 cisco/
│   ├── 📋 inventory/
│   │   ├── 📋 inventory.ini
│   ├── 📄 README.md
```
Let's break down these components:

1. Python Directory
The heart of your NDE is the Python directory. Here, you'll find everything you need to work with Python for network management.

2. Runbooks
The runbooks directory is where you'll find Python scripts tailored for specific tasks. Whether you need to configure Linux servers or Cisco devices, you'll find dedicated directories for each.

🐧 linux_config: This directory contains Python scripts for configuring and managing Linux servers. From automating user account creation to setting up services, these scripts make Linux server management a breeze.

📡 cisco_config: If you're working with Cisco networking equipment, this directory holds Python scripts designed for Cisco device configuration and management. Say goodbye to repetitive, manual configurations.

3. Templates
The templates directory provides pre-defined templates for your Python scripts. These templates are designed to save you time and effort when creating new scripts.

🐧 linux: Inside this subdirectory, you'll find templates for working with Linux systems. These templates ensure consistency and accuracy in your Linux server management tasks.

📡 cisco: If you're configuring Cisco devices, the templates in this subdirectory will guide you in creating scripts for various Cisco configurations.

4. Inventory
The inventory directory is essential for maintaining a clear view of your network assets. It includes the inventory.ini file, which you can use with inventory management tools like Ansible or custom Python scripts.

Getting Started
To make the most of your Python Networking Development Environment:

Explore the runbooks directory to find Python scripts that suit your specific needs.

Use the templates in the templates directory as a starting point for creating your Python scripts. Customize them to fit your network's requirements.

Maintain an up-to-date inventory using the inventory.ini file in the inventory directory. This inventory can be used for various network automation tasks.

Refer to this README.md whenever you need guidance on the structure of your NDE.

In conclusion, Python is your trusted companion for network administration and engineering tasks. With this organized environment, you'll be able to maximize the power of Python for network management, save time, and ensure consistency in your network configurations. Happy networking!
